# LicenseKeys

LicenseKeys is a PHP application written on the [Laravel](http://laravel.com/) PHP Framework. It is intended to allow developers to be able to license their applications without having to create a licensing system of their own.

## Getting Started
We are still in the early development stage so please understand that the product may not yet be at a place for release, stay tuned for more!

## Built With
